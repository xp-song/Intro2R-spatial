# Intro2R-spatial

This repository contains teaching materials for a workshop on analysing spatial patterns of the landscape, using the R programming language. 

The workshop introduces the use of __landscape metrics__ to quantify the *composition* and *configuration* of the physical landscape. It assumes that you have basic knowledge of GIS (i.e. coordinate reference systems, rasters and vectors).


## Workshop outline:

1. Why analyse spatial patterns?

2. Landscape ecology: Conceptual models

3. Land cover classification

4. Landscape metrics


## Instructions:

You will need to have [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed on your computer. [Download the materials for this workshop](https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R-spatial/archive/master.zip) from the Github repository [Intro2R-spatial](https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R-spatial).
