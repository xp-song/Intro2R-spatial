# Intro2R-spatial

This repository contains teaching materials for a workshop on analysing spatial patterns of the physical landscape. 

The workshop introduces the use of R to classify land cover and to quantify landscape composition/configuration. It assumes that you have basic knowledge of GIS (i.e. coordinate reference systems, rasters and vectors) and the R programming language.
