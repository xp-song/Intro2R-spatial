# Intro2R-spatial

This repository contains teaching materials for a workshop on analysing spatial patterns of the physical landscape. 

The workshop introduces the use of R to classify land cover and to quantify landscape composition/configuration. It assumes that you have basic knowledge of GIS (i.e. coordinate reference systems, rasters and vectors) and the R programming language. You can read more about the workshop in this [blogpost](https://xp-song.github.io/posts/intro2r-spatial/), or preview the slide deck directly [here](https://xp-song.github.io/files/slides/Intro2r_spatial/1_Intro2Rspatial_slides#1).

<br>

## Workshop outline

1. Why analyse spatial patterns?

2. Landscape ecology: Conceptual models

3. Land cover classification

4. Landscape metrics

<br>

## Instructions

You will need to have [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed on your computer. [Download the materials for this workshop](https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R-spatial/archive/master.zip) from the Github repository [Intro2R-spatial](https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R-spatial).
