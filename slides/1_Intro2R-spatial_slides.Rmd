# Spatial pattern of a landscape

### A function of the *__composition__* and *configuration* of the physical landscape

???
- What is this landscape composed of?

# Spatial pattern of a landscape

### **Spatial composition**
- Variety - What types/classes?
- Abundance - How much?

???
- E.g. Classify as green, blue, grey
- Absolute (i.e. total area) or relative (%) abundance

# Spatial pattern of a landscape

### A function of the *composition* and *__configuration__* of the physical landscape

???
- Quantifying this is more complex

# Spatial pattern of a landscape

### **Spatial configuration**
- Position
- Orientation
- Shape/arrangement

???
What if...
1. Plants on the left... buildings/roads were on the right?
2. Greenery at the waterfront... urban cover was inland?
3. Greenery finely interspersed with the grey cover?


- Configuration -> The idea of "connectectivity" becomes relevant

# Why is spatial pattern important?

### The study of landscape ecology  

<sup> </sup>

```{r diagram, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
library(DiagrammeR)
m <- mermaid("graph LR;
		   A(Spatial Patterns) --> B(Ecological Processes);
		   B(Ecological Processes)--> A(Spatial Patterns);
		   B(Ecological Processes) --> C(City Sustainability & Resilience);
		   C(City Sustainability & Resilience) --> D(Human Well-being);
		   ")
widgetframe::frameWidget(m, height = 230, width = '100%')
```

.right[.small[*Figure adopted from Wu et al. (2015)*]]

???
- One area of study tt is highly relevant...
- Spatial pattern reflects underlying ecological processes & vice versa (reciprocal effect)
- What are some examples of pattern-process relationships? 
  - Topography & hydrological processes
  - Plants & carbon storage

__Pattern-process relationships__  
  
- How do we optimise spatial *patterns* to achieve desired ecological *processes*?  
- How can we incorporate such thinking into policy & design?  

???
- Some questions...

# Landscape ecology: Conceptual models

__Mosaic model vs. Gradient model__  


???
- Previously, we talked about green/grey cover
- Characterised the landscape into discrete classes (Mosaic)
- But... Canopy above road.... Where does the forest end? Are we oversimplifying...?
- Soft edges between classes (Gradient)?
